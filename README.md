### Data Engineering Learning Project
Project to learn Data Engineering and Big Data technologies. The project is divided into multiple modules, each module focusing on a specific technology or concept. The modules are designed to be independent of each other, so that they can be studied in any order. The modules are designed to be hands-on, with each module having a set of exercises that can be completed to gain a better understanding of the technology or concept being studied.

### Modules
1. [Introduction to Data Engineering](modules/01-introduction-to-data-engineering/README.md)
2. [Data Modeling](modules/02-data-modeling/README.md)
3. [Data Warehousing](modules/03-data-warehousing/README.md)
4. [ETL](modules/04-etl/README.md)
5. [Data Lakes](modules/05-data-lakes/README.md)
6. [Data Streaming](modules/06-data-streaming/README.md)
7. [Data Pipelines](modules/07-data-pipelines/README.md)
8. [Data Quality](modules/08-data-quality/README.md)
9. [Data Governance](modules/09-data-governance/README.md)
10. [Data Security](modules/10-data-security/README.md)
11. [Data Engineering in the Cloud](modules/11-data-engineering-in-the-cloud/README.md)
12. [Data Engineering at Scale](modules/12-data-engineering-at-scale/README.md)

### Study Plan
The study plan for this project is as follows:
1. Read the README file for the module you are interested in.
2. Complete the exercises in the module.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each module you are interested in.
